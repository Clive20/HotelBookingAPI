# Hotel Booking Application Programming Interface (API)
Hotel Booking API is a RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core, designed to handle hotel management and booking functionalities. This project was developed by following a tutorial to strengthen my understanding of ASP.NET Core fundamentals, including API design, CRUD operations, and entity relationships.

# Features:
- Room Management: Add, update, and delete hotel rooms.
- Booking System: Create and manage reservations.
- User Authentication: Secure access with role-based authorization.
- Data Persistence: Uses a database to store room and booking information.

This project provided valuable experience in building scalable APIs, managing data using Entity Framework Core, and applying best practices in ASP.NET Core development.
